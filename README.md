# F1-EV Score: Measuring the Likelihood of Estimating a Good Decision Threshold for Semi-Supervised Anomaly Detection

Implementation of the threshold-independent performance measure F1-EV and its bounded version for semi-supervised anomaly detection. The script is designed to be evaluated with output files of the anomaly detection tasks of the DCASE challenge

## Instructions

Just run the script and pass the folders containing the predictions and the folder containing the labels as arguments.

## Reference

When reusing (parts of) the code, a reference to the following paper would be appreciated:
